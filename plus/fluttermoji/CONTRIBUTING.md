Below you will find the process and workflow used to review and merge your changes.
## Step 0 : Go through the README and the demo
- The `README.md` file is the best presentation of this project and to accompany that I have a running demo [here](https://psk907.github.io/fluttermoji).
- I encourage you to check them out to quickly get an idea of this project.

## Step 1 : Find an issue
- Take a look at the Existing Issues or create your **own** Issues!
- Wait for the Issue to be assigned to you after which you can start working on it.
- Note : Every change in this project should/must have an associated issue. This helps us easily communicate and document changes.

## Step 2 : Fork the Project
- Fork this Repository. This will create a Local Copy of this Repository on your Github Profile. Keep a reference to the original project in `upstream` remote.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/fluttermoji
$ cd fluttermoji
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/psk907/fluttermoji
```

- If you have already forked the project, update your copy before working.
```
$ git remote update
$ git checkout <branch-name>
$ git rebase upstream/<branch-name>
```
## Step 3 : Branch
Create a new branch. Use its name to identify the issue your addressing.
```
# It will create a new branch with name branch_name and switch to that branch 
$ git checkout -b branch_name
```
## Step 4 : Work on the issue assigned
- Work on the issue(s) assigned to you. 
- You can use the example app to test out changes in realtime.
```
# To run the example project
$ cd example
$ flutter run
```

## Step 5 : Add and Commit changes
- IMPORTANT: You need to be in the project root folder _(not in `fluttermoji/example/` )_ for all git commands.
```
# To go back to the project root from example folder
$ cd ..
```
  > or you can just launch a new terminal window in `fluttermoji/` folder 

- Add all the files/folders needed.
- After you've made changes or made your contribution to the project add changes to the branch you've just created by:
```
# To add all new files and changes to branch branch_name
$ git add .
```
- To commit give a descriptive message for the convenience of reviewer by:
```
# This message get associated with all files you have changed
$ git commit -m 'message summarizing changes'
```
## Step 6 : Push changes
- Now you are ready to push your work to the remote repository.
- When your work is ready, complies with the project conventions and is working all fine, upload your changes to your fork:

```
# To push your work to your remote repository
$ git push -u origin branch_name
```

## Step 7 : Create the Pull Request (PR)
- Go to the forked repository in your browser and click on *Compare and pull requests*. Then add a **title** and **description** to your pull request that explains your contribution.
- I also encourage you to add any screenshots/examples that explain your changes.

- Voila! Your Pull Request has been submitted and will be reviewed by the moderators and merged.ü•≥
